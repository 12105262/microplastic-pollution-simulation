# Microplastic Pollution Simulation

## Description
This project simulates microplastic pollution levels based on weather conditions such as temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The data is fetched in real-time from the OpenWeather API.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (like `cJSON` and `curl`).
3. Compile the C program using the Makefile or manually using `gcc`.
4. Run the program and provide the required inputs such as city name and OpenWeather API key.

## Technologies Used
- C programming language
- OpenWeather API
- cJSON library
- curl for data fetching
